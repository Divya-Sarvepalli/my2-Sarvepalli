###### Vacation Spot : Ooty
I love Ooty because of the **climate**. It always have the low temperature and the **nature** was so soothing, **greenary** after the rain was the best. Also, it's famous for **Tea Estates** where the original and natural tea is prepared. Serving a fresh hot tea with cool climate makes a perfect evening.
